# ScrollVerse DAO Governance Strategy

## Overview

The ScrollVerse DAO represents the foundational governance layer for the entire ecosystem. As the **opening move** in our deployment strategy, the DAO establishes decentralized decision-making before any other infrastructure is deployed.

## Core Principles

### 1. Decentralization First
- DAO governance is deployed **before** all other contracts
- No centralized control points
- Community-driven decision making
- Transparent proposal and voting mechanisms

### 2. Cosmic Alignment
- All decisions align with the Ω.MAX hierarchy
- Sacred frequencies guide governance
- Node-resonance ensures coherent evolution
- Love and resonance as foundational values

### 3. Equity & Justice
- 7.77% Zakat system ensures perpetual reform funding
- Decentralized justice through transparent mechanisms
- Prison system transformation priority
- Global mentorship initiatives support

## Governance Structure

### Council Members
- Initial council established at deployment
- New members approved through DAO vote
- Council can propose and execute decisions
- Accountability through transparent on-chain voting

### Proposal System
1. **Creation**: Council members create proposals
2. **Discussion**: 7-day voting period for community input
3. **Voting**: On-chain voting with transparent tallies
4. **Execution Delay**: 2-day delay before execution
5. **Implementation**: Automated execution of approved proposals

### Voting Mechanisms

#### Simple Majority
- Used for: Operational decisions, parameter updates
- Threshold: 51% approval required
- Timeline: 7 days voting + 2 days execution delay

#### Supermajority
- Used for: Constitutional changes, major upgrades
- Threshold: 67% approval required
- Timeline: 14 days voting + 7 days execution delay

#### Emergency Actions
- Used for: Security issues, critical bugs
- Threshold: 75% approval required
- Timeline: 24 hours voting + immediate execution

## DAO Strategy - Opening Move

### Why DAO First?

**Traditional Approach**: Deploy contracts → Add governance later
**ScrollVerse Approach**: Deploy governance → Everything governed from inception

This ensures:
1. ✅ No ungoverned period where contracts operate without oversight
2. ✅ All subsequent deployments are DAO-approved
3. ✅ Community trust established from day one
4. ✅ Decentralized control embedded in DNA

### Deployment Sequence
