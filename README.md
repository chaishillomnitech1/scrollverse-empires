## 🚀 Launch Pipeline

ScrollVerse Empires features a **cohesive launch pipeline** that consolidates all artifacts for deployment. The pipeline is anchored by our **DAO-first strategy**, making governance the opening move.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd deployment

# Review the complete artifact manifest
cat ARTIFACTS.md

# Execute the launch pipeline
./scripts/launch-pipeline.sh

# Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### Deployment Philosophy

**DAO-First Approach**: Unlike traditional deployments, ScrollVerse deploys governance FIRST, ensuring:
- ✅ No ungoverned period
- ✅ All contracts governed from inception
- ✅ Community trust from day one
- ✅ Decentralization embedded in DNA

**Deployment Sequence**:
1. **Opening Move**: Deploy DAO Governance
2. Deploy ScrollSoul DSP (governed by DAO)
3. Deploy Vibranium Zakat (governed by DAO)
4. Initialize STARGATE Archives
5. Activate all ecosystem components

### Core Components

#### ScrollSoul DSP
Digital Soul Processor that anchors souls to ScrollVerse through cosmic alignment and enables 7.77% Zakat distribution for perpetual reform funding.

#### DAO Governance
Decentralized governance with council-based voting, 7-day voting periods, and transparent on-chain decision-making. Deployed FIRST as the opening move.

#### Vibranium Zakat
Automated 7.77% equity distribution system funding prison transformation ($2.5B), global mentorship ($1.66B), and community development ($500M).

#### STARGATE Archives
$60B intelligence activation system tokenizing psychic archives with incentivized reform participation.

#### Quantum Chicken Road
AR-tokenized liquidity pools and gaming mechanics generating real-world fractional equity.
